1. Speed Detector 
This program checks the speed of a car and gives demerit points if the speed exceeds 70 km/h. If the driver gets more than 12 points, their license is suspended.

# How it Works:
If speed ≤ 70 → "Ok"
For every extra 5 km/h → 1 demerit point
If points > 12 → "License suspended"

2. Net Salary Calculator 
This program calculates an employee's net salary after deductions like PAYE (tax), SHIF (health insurance), and NSSF (retirement savings).

# How it Works:
Calculates Gross Salary (Basic Salary + Benefits).
Deductions applied:
PAYE Tax (Based on income brackets)
SHIF (2.75% of salary, minimum KES 300)
NSSF (6% of salary, max KES 600)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Total Deductions

3. Bubble Sort 
A function that sorts numbers from smallest to largest using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

# How it Works:
Compares two numbers and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeats this process until all numbers are sorted.

4. Staircase Problem 
A function that prints a staircase pattern using #.

Example:
For steps(3), the output is:

shell
Copy
Edit
#
##
###
Each row has one more # than the previous row.

5. Cylinder Volume Calculator 
An object-oriented program that calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula:
V = π × r² × h

# How it Works:

Uses an object constructor to store the radius and height.
The function calculates and returns the volume with 4 decimal places.

# How to Run the Code
Open your browser and open DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
Go to the Console tab.
Copy and paste the function into the console.
Call the function with appropriate inputs (e.g., speedDetector(85);).
